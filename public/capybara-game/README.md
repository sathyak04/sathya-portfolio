# Capybara Run! 🍊

A fast-paced **2D side-scrolling game** built with **JavaScript, HTML, and Kaboom.js (KAPLAY)**.  
You play as a capybara, dodging obstacles and eating oranges to keep running.  
Simple mechanics, smooth gameplay, and a playful twist on the classic endless runner genre.  
The game structure also highlights **object-oriented programming (OOP)** ideas—treating the player, obstacles, and collectibles as objects with their own properties and behaviors, making the code easier to extend and maintain.
